Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model to classify loan applications as approved or rejected. This model can be useful for financial institutions to automate the loan approval process, thereby reducing manual effort and potential biases.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle Loan Prediction Dataset. It contains various features such as applicant's personal information, loan details, and demographic information.

Dataset Overview
Train file: A CSV file containing the training data.
Test file: A CSV file containing the testing data.
Submission file: A sample submission file in CSV format.
Features
Loan_ID: Unique Loan ID
Gender: Male/Female
Married: Applicant married (Y/N)
Dependents: Number of dependents
Education: Applicant Education (Graduate/Undergraduate)
Self_Employed: Self-employed (Y/N)
ApplicantIncome: Applicant income
CoapplicantIncome: Coapplicant income
LoanAmount: Loan amount in thousands
Loan_Amount_Term: Term of loan in months
Credit_History: Credit history meets guidelines
Property_Area: Urban/Semi-Urban/Rural
Loan_Status: Loan approved (Y/N) - target variable
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can install the required packages using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv loan_pred_env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
loan_pred_env\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source loan_pred_env/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-prediction-xgboost.git
cd loan-prediction-xgboost
Prepare the data:
Ensure the dataset files are placed in the appropriate directory (data/ by default).

Run the model training script:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Make predictions:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input data/test.csv --output results/predictions.csv
Model Training
The model training involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Building: Using the XGBoost algorithm to train the model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using techniques like GridSearchCV to find the best parameters.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-prediction-xgboost.git
cd loan-prediction-xgboost
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To train the model and make predictions:

Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Make predictions using the trained model:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input data/sample_input.csv

Web Application
A Streamlit-based web application has been developed to provide an interactive user interface for loan prediction.

To run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to use the application.
